Plot a mesh's scalar array with an opacity trasfer funciton

################################################################################
# It's possible to apply an opacity mapping to any scalar array plotted. You can
# specify either a single static value to make the mesh opaque on all cells, or
# use a transfer function where the scalar array plotted is mapped to the opacity.
#
# Opacity transfer function options are:
#
# - ``'linear'``: linearly vary (increase) opacity across the plotted scalar range from low to high
# - ``'linear_r'``: linearly vary (increase) opacity across the plotted scalar range from high to low
# - ``'geom'``: on a log scale, vary (increase) opacity across the plotted scalar range from low to high
# - ``'geom_r'``: on a log scale, vary (increase) opacity across the plotted scalar range from high to low
