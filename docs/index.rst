``vtki`` is a helper module for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) that takes a
different approach on interfacing with VTK through NumPy and direct array access.
This module simplifies mesh creation and plotting by adding functionality to
existing VTK objects.

This module can be used for scientific plotting for presentations and research
papers as well as a supporting module for other mesh dependent Python modules.


Installation
------------
If you have a working copy of VTK, installation is simply::

    $ pip install vtki

You can also visit `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vtki>`_ or
`GitHub <https://github.com/akaszynski/vtki>`_ to download the source.

See :ref:`install_ref` for more details.


Highlights
----------

* Pythonic interface to VTK's Python-C++ bindings
* Filtering/plotting tools built for interactivity in Jupyter notebooks (see :ref:`ipy_tools_ref`)
* Direct access to common VTK filters (see :ref:`filters_ref`)
* Intuitive plotting routines with ``matplotlib`` similar syntax (see :ref:`plotting_ref`)


Connections
-----------

``vtki`` is a powerful tool that researchers can harness to create compelling,
integrated visualizations of large datasets in an intuitive, Pythonic manner.
Here are a few open-source projects that leverage ``vtki``:

* PVGeo_: Python package of VTK-based algorithms to analyze geoscientific data and models
* omfvtk_: 3D visualization for the Open Mining Format (omf)
