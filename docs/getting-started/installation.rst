Installation
============

Installing ``vtki`` itself is quite straightforward as it can be installed
using ``pip``::

  pip install vtki

``vtki`` requires ``numpy``, ``imageio``, and ``VTK`` version 7.0 or newer
which should be installed by pip automatically. If you experience issues
installing VTK, please continue reading the next section.


Install the Visualization Toolkit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) can be installed using pip for most versions of
Python::

  pip install vtk

If this command fails, install VTK by installing from a distribution like
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ and then installing VTK for
Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 by running the following::

    conda install -c conda-forge vtk

Install vtki from `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vtki>`_ by running::

Alternatively, you can install the latest version from GitHub by visiting

running::

    cd C:\Where\You\Downloaded\vtki
    pip install .

You can test your installation by running an example:

    examples.plot_wave()

See other examples:
